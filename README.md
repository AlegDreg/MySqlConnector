# MySqlConnector

You can use this project to connect to a remote MySQL database and run queries in it.

The IDB interface has two methods - DoRequest for executing the request and getting the bool execution value (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE e.t.c.) and GetDataTable to execute the query and get the resulting table (SELECT)
